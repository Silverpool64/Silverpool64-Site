Silent Line: Armored Core "Morning, Thinker"
DragonAvenger, Mattias Häggström Gerdt

LYRICS:
I'm a thinker.
I'm a thinker.

[Chorus x5]
I'm a thinker.
I could break it down.
I’m a shooter.
A drastic baby.

I'm a thinker.
I could break it down.
I'm a thinker, thinker, thinker...

Thinker, thinker, thinker, thinker...
Thinker, thinker, thinker, thinker...
Thinker, thinker, thinker, thinker...
Thinker, thinker, thinker, thinker...

[Chorus x4]

I'm a thinker.
I'm a thinker.
I'm a thinker.
I'm a thinker.

[Chorus x4]

I'm a thinker.
